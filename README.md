# Scalable Collision Avoidance RL

 Multi agent scalable reinforcement learning for formation control with collision avoidance

 This is part of my Mater's Thesis at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden. Currently work in progress. The scalable part of this work is inspired by the paper [Scalable Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Networked Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02906)
